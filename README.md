# FTC Team 22358 - BigData
## 2023-2024 CENTERSTAGE Season

### About Our Team
We are **BigData**, Team #22358 from **Forest Hills High School** in Queens, New York. We compete in the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC), a robotics competition that challenges high school students to design, build, program, and compete with robots.

### About CENTERSTAGE
CENTERSTAGE is the 2023-2024 FTC game inspired by the art and technology used in theater and stage productions. In this competition:

- **Game Objective**: Robots must place pixel elements onto a backdrop to create mosaics while navigating a stage-themed playing field
- **Autonomous Period**: Robots operate independently for the first 30 seconds, using sensors and pre-programmed instructions to score points
- **Driver-Controlled Period**: Teams take manual control for 2 minutes to maximize scoring by placing pixels and completing bonus objectives
- **Endgame**: Robots can launch paper airplanes (drones) and park in designated areas for additional points

### Robot Functions
Our robot is designed to:

- **Navigate autonomously** using computer vision and sensors to detect pixel positions and scoring locations
- **Manipulate game elements** with a custom-designed intake and placement mechanism for handling pixel blocks
- **Score efficiently** by placing pixels onto the backdrop to create scoring patterns
- **Execute endgame tasks** including drone launching and strategic positioning
- **Adapt to match strategy** with driver-controlled movements for optimal point accumulation

### Repository Purpose
This repository contains the code that powers our robot throughout the CENTERSTAGE season, including autonomous routines, teleop controls, and utility functions for hardware management.
